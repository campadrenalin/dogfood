dogfood
=======

JSON serialization for custom Python classes. To make any class serializable,
either

* add the attribute __food__
* subclass Food

You'll also need to supply an __encode__() method that returns a list in the
form:

  def __encode__(self):
      return ['ClassName', [self.arg, self.arg2]]

Where ClassName is the name of your class, and the arguments in the list
are those to create a new instance. This module does not support repopulating
the __dict__ of the object, just recreating from the __init__ arguments.
